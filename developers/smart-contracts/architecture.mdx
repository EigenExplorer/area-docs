The Liquid AVS Token (LAT) protocol enables **direct restaking** through a modular and extensible smart contract system. It routes user deposits to Autonomous Verifiable Services (AVSs) via LAT issuance, rebalancing mechanisms, and staker node coordination -— without relying on centralized intermediaries.

Below is a breakdown of the protocol architecture and core user flow:

## User Entry: `LiquidToken`

Users deposit supported tokens into the `LiquidToken` contract. Exchange rates are fetched from the `TokenRegistry`, which is updated by the `TokenRegistryOracle`. Based on these rates, `LiquidToken` mints LATs (Liquid AVS Tokens) that represent the user’s staked position.

LATs can be transferred, traded, or redeemed by the user at any time, enabling liquidity and flexibility.

## Restaking Infrastructure

The `LiquidTokenManager` serves as the execution layer for restaking. 

It:
- Handles deposits and internal accounting
- Coordinates token flows across the system
- Interfaces with the `EE Re-staking Manager`

The **EE Re-staking Manager** manages:

- Rebalancing LAT-backed assets across multiple AVSs
- Delegation of assets to staker nodes
- Handling slashing, exits, or validator set changes

This off-chain logic enables dynamic routing without compromising on-chain security guarantees.

## Staker Nodes & Coordination

Each `StakerNode` is a smart contract that holds a portion of the total delegated capital. These nodes:

- Interact directly with EigenLayer strategies
- Submit assets on behalf of LAT holders
- Earn yield based on performance and AVS allocation

The `Staker Node Coordinator` manages the entire set of nodes, routing deposits and rebalancing assets across them. It abstracts complex delegation logic and ensures optimal capital distribution.

## Restaking on EigenLayer

In the final step, assets held by each `StakerNode` are deposited into registered EigenLayer strategies. These strategies secure various AVSs and generate rewards that flow back to LAT holders.
