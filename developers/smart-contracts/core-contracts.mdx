The LAT protocol is composed of a set of core smart contracts that coordinate user deposits, token issuance, restaking delegation, and interaction with EigenLayer. 

Both users and the off-chain restaking manager interface with these contracts.

## Core Contracts Overview

| Contract               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`LiquidToken`](https://github.com/EigenExplorer/liquid-avs-token/blob/dev/docs/core/LiquidToken.sol.md)         | ERC-20 compliant contract that handles user deposits and withdrawals. It mints LAT tokens representing liquid staked positions and manages share-based accounting.                                   |
| [`LiquidTokenManager`](https://github.com/EigenExplorer/liquid-avs-token/blob/dev/docs/core/LiquidTokenManager.sol.md)    | Oversees the allocation of deposited assets across supported strategies. It interacts with `StakerNodes` and manages the addition/removal of supported assets.                                       |
| [`StakerNodeCoordinator`](https://github.com/EigenExplorer/liquid-avs-token/blob/dev/docs/core/StakerNodeCoordinator.sol.md) | Factory and registry for all `StakerNode` instances. Maintains upgrade paths, manages permissions, and links node infrastructure to the broader protocol.                                             |
| [`StakerNode`](https://github.com/EigenExplorer/liquid-avs-token/blob/dev/docs/core/StakerNode.sol.md)             | Contract representing an individual node that interacts with EigenLayer. It handles delegation, restaking, and withdrawal operations, while reporting back to the coordinator.                        |

## Contract Details

### `LiquidToken` 

<Info>[View Full Contract Documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/EigenExplorer/liquid-avs-token/blob/dev/docs/core/LiquidToken.sol.md)</Info>

The `LiquidToken` contract is the user-facing entry point of the LAT protocol. It:

- Accepts deposits of supported assets
- Mints LAT tokens based on exchange rates from the `TokenRegistry`
- Tracks user balances via a share-based accounting system
- Enables redemption of LAT for underlying assets
- Integrates standard ERC-20 behavior (transfer, approve, etc.)

Additional security features include:

- **Access control** for critical functions
- **Pausability** in case of system emergencies
- **Reentrancy protection** to prevent attack vectors

### `LiquidTokenManager`

<Info>[View Full Contract Documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/EigenExplorer/liquid-avs-token/blob/dev/docs/core/LiquidTokenManager.sol.md)</Info>

The `LiquidTokenManager` orchestrates the flow of assets post-deposit. It:

- Coordinates distribution of deposited assets across `StakerNodes`
- Interfaces with the restaking manager for rebalancing decisions
- Maintains the mapping between LAT-supported tokens and EigenLayer strategies
- Provides public read functions for system-wide balance and configuration data

This contract serves as the control plane for reallocation and system-wide governance logic.

### `StakerNode`

<Info>[View Full Contract Documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/EigenExplorer/liquid-avs-token/blob/dev/docs/core/StakerNode.sol.md)</Info>

Each `StakerNode` contract acts as a delegate node that:

- Interacts directly with EigenLayer to restake capital
- Submits deposits, handles delegation logic, and manages withdrawal requests
- Tracks staking rewards attributable to its assigned capital
- Supports upgradeability via the `StakerNodeCoordinator`

StakerNodes are modular and independently upgradable, allowing for scalable deployment of restaked capital across strategies.

### `StakerNodeCoordinator`

<Info>[View Full Contract Documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/EigenExplorer/liquid-avs-token/blob/dev/docs/core/StakerNodeCoordinator.sol.md)</Info>

The `StakerNodeCoordinator` serves as the authoritative manager for all deployed `StakerNode` contracts. It:

- Deploys and registers new `StakerNode` instances
- Manages upgradability of existing nodes
- Acts as a permissioned registry for contract role management
- Ensures consistency and observability across the node infrastructure

By centralizing the lifecycle management of nodes, this contract ensures operational cohesion across the LAT restaking network.
