Area offers a suite of RESTful APIs designed for developers and community users to seamlessly interact with the Liquid AVS Token (LAT) ecosystem. Whether you're making deposits, retrieving user positions, or accessing AVS-specific metrics, our API provides a clean and efficient way to integrate LAT functionality into your application.

The LAT API follows industry standards:
- Resource-oriented URL structure
- Form-encoded request bodies
- JSON-encoded responses
- Standard HTTP verbs, status codes, and authentication patterns

The LAT API is **open and free to use** â€”- no authentication required.

## Base URL
The LAT API uses the following base URL:
```
https://api.area.club
```

## Get Started
To begin, try retrieving all available Liquid AVS Tokens using our interactive documentation: [Retrieve All LATs](developers/api-reference/endpoint/lat/retrieve-all-liquid-avs-tokens-lats).

This is the fastest way to explore LAT assets and begin building with restaking data.
