## Welcome

This section provides an in-depth guide to the LAT protocol for developers integrating, building on, or maintaining the LAT system. It covers core contract responsibilities, key APIs, architectural design, and usage patterns. This is the foundational reference for engineers working on protocol-level interactions.

### Overview

LAT (Liquid AVS Token) is a tokenized representation of staked assets restaked into EigenLayer via a modular delegation system. The LAT system introduces a transparent, composable, and user-aligned model for liquid restaking.

Composable: LATs are ERC-20 tokens that represent positions restaked into specific AVSs.

Deterministic: Every LAT traces directly to its originating deposit and associated AVS.

Modular: StakerNodes delegate assets across strategies and can be dynamically created or upgraded.

### System Flow

[User] → [LiquidToken] → [LiquidTokenManager] → [StakerNode] → [EigenLayer Strategy]

Users deposit supported assets, receive LAT tokens, and those assets are delegated through a node infrastructure to the EigenLayer network.
