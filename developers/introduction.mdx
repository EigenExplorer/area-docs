## Welcome

Area’s Liquid AVS Token (LAT) protocol is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid restaking system that enables users to directly restake assets into supported Autonomous Verifiable Services (AVSs).

This section is your comprehensive guide to integrating with, building on, and maintaining the LAT system. It covers smart contract architecture, API interfaces, usage patterns, and developer best practices.

### What is LAT?

The Liquid AVS Token (LAT) is a tokenized representation of assets restaked through EigenLayer into specific AVSs via Area’s modular delegation system. LAT introduces a new asset class in the restaking ecosystem -- combining liquidity, programmability, and AVS-specific alignment

LAT is part of the **Direct Liquid Restaking** framework, providing a cleaner and more deterministic path from restaked capital to AVS utility.

#### Key Properties of LAT

- **Composable**: LATs are standard ERC-20 tokens representing restaked positions in individual AVSs. They can be integrated with DeFi protocols, transferred, or used in new financial primitives.

- **Deterministic**: Each LAT is traceable to its original deposit and target AVS, offering transparency and accountability for both stakers and AVSs.

- **Modular**: The system is powered by *StakerNodes* —- autonomous agents that manage delegation strategies, staking flows, and upgrades across LAT positions.
