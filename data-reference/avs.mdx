AVS data is aggregated from the EigenLayer AVS Directory smart contract. Specifically, we collect the `AVSMetadataURIUpdated` event logs from the AVS Directory smart contract. These event logs contain the metadata URI of the AVS, which includes the AVS name, description, and other relevant information.
