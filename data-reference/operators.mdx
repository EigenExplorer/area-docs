Operator data is aggregated from the EigenLayer Delegation Manager smart contract. Specifically, we collect the `OperatorMetadataURIUpdated` and `OperatorAVSRegistrationStatusUpdated` event logs from the Delegation Manager contract. These logs contain the metadata URI of the Operator, which includes the Operator's name, description, and other relevant information.
