### LST Strategy TVL

LST strategy data is retrieved directly from its token balance with the EigenLayer Strategy smart contract. For LST strategy TVL, we provide both raw and normalized TVL data.

-   Raw TVL data: The total value locked in the strategy in LST tokens.
-   Normalized TVL data: The total value locked in ETH, with the exchange rate retrieved at the listed timestamp from CoinMarketCap.

### Beacon Chain TVL

<Note>
    {' '}
    Aligning with the methodology used on the EigenLayer Dashboard, we use raw balances
    and do not count queued withdrawals.
</Note>
Beacon Chain TVL is calculated by aggregating all EigenPods registered in the EigenPodManager
smart contract. We then query all Beacon Chain validators that have set a registered
EigenPod as their withdrawal address. The total value locked in the Beacon Chain
is determined by multiplying the number of validators by the minimum staking requirement
of 32 ETH.

## Miscellaneous

### TVL Conversion

We provide both raw data (in native tokens) and normalized data (in ETH) for TVL. Normalized data is calculated by fetching the exchange rate from CoinMarketCap at the timestamp of the data point.
