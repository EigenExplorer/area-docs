## Steps for Acquiring LAT & Inner Workflows

<Tip>
    The Liquid AVS Token (LAT) smart contracts utilize EigenLayer's native smart
    contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, minimizing implementation
    risks for users.
</Tip>

Acquiring Liquid AVS Token (LAT) is as simple as clicking a button, with all processes seamlessly handled by EigenExplorer's smart contracts.

<Steps>
    <Step title='Choose Your Desired AVS'>
        Select the AVS you wish to support from the list available on
        EigenExplorer and click the "Stake" button. This action initiates your
        participation in the chosen AVS.
    </Step>
    <Step title='Automatic Operator Delegation'>
        <Info>
            This step is managed internally by the EigenExplorer smart
            contracts.
        </Info>
        The selection of operators is managed automatically (You don't actually need
        to do anything here! Woohoo!). The restaked token is channeled to your chosen
        AVS through a selection process that prioritizes operators with a high percentage
        of that AVS's operator share or those that exclusively operate that specific
        AVS.
    </Step>
    <Step title='Generate Liquid AVS Token'>
        The corresponding amount of LAT is generated as an on-chain
        representation of the your staked position, along with any rewards that
        position will accrue.
    </Step>
    <Step title='Getting Back Your Staked Token'>
        To retrieve your staked token and rewards, simply trade your LAT on any
        supported exchange or unbond your LAT on EigenExplorer.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Assets

Depending the asset of your choice, there are currently two ways for acquiring a LAT.

<Steps>
    <Step title='With AVS Native Token'>
        Users are able to stake their AVS token(s) into the corresponding AVS,
        receiving the liquid staked equivalent in return. For example, users
        could deposit the EigenDA token (EIGEN) into EigenDA on EigenExplorer,
        receiving xEIGEN in return.
    </Step>
    <Step title='With LST or Native ETH'>
        Users are also able to deposit LST or native ETH into a specific AVS,
        with the ETH deposited exclusively amongst operators for that specific
        AVS. For example, users could stake ETH into EigenExplorer and allocate
        it to EigenDA, which would be delegated exclusively to EigenDA
        operators. The userâ€™s stake is siloed to the AVS they wish to support,
        and they receive xEIGEN in return.
