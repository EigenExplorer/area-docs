<Tip> Area leverages EigenLayer’s native smart contracts deployed on Ethereum, minimizing implementation risks and ensuring security for users. </Tip>

Restaking with Area is designed to be simple and seamless — just a few clicks, and the smart contracts handle the rest.

<Steps> 
    <Step title='Choose Your Desired AVS'> 
        Select the AVS you want to support from the list available on Area, then click the **"Restake"** button. This action starts your participation in the chosen AVS. 
    </Step> 

    <Step title='Automatic Operator Delegation'> 
        <Info> This step is fully managed by Area’s smart contracts — no action needed on your part! </Info> 

        Operator selection happens automatically. Your restaked tokens are routed to the selected AVS operators through a process that prioritizes yield and AVS exposure. 
    </Step> 

    <Step title='Receive Liquid AVS Token (LAT)'> 
        Once staked, you’ll receive **Liquid AVS Tokens (LAT)** as an on-chain representation of your position. LAT reflects both your staked amount and the rewards it will generate.
    </Step> 

    <Step title='Unstake or Trade Your LAT'> 
        To exit your position, simply trade your LAT on any supported exchange or unbond directly through Area to redeem your original staked tokens along with any accrued rewards. 
    </Step>
