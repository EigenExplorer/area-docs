Liquid AVS Token introduces a modular restaking asset that simplifies and balances EigenLayerâ€™s token landscape, empowering both users and AVS teams.

Because of the unique design of LAT, users can enjoy the following benefits:

<Card title='Direct AVS Support' icon='down-to-bracket'>
    Users can directly support the protocols they find compelling, rather than
    having their staking contributions bundled for general validation and
    rewarded inefficiently with yields from less attractive projects. This
    approach allows users to retain direct risk exposure to their chosen AVS,
    enabling them to restake according to their individual risk and return
    preferences.

<Card title='Improved Yield' icon='rocket-launch'>
    In addition to the yield or rewards generated by the AVS, LAT holders also
    receive EigenLayer rewards in the form of EIGEN tokens and EigenExplorer
    rewards. These rewards are auto-compounded for further yield optimization.

    With renewed access to liquidity, EigenExplorer users can utilize LATs
    across various DeFi protocols. The token can be traded, invested, and used
    as collateral like any other cryptocurrency, in addition to its AVS-specific
    functions.

<Card title='Streamlined User Experience' icon='bars-staggered'>
    The direct re(staking) process eliminates the need for users to worry about
    operator selection in the traditional restaking workflow. Once users choose
    their desired AVS, they simply click the stake button, and they are good to
    go.

    Due to the direct risk and return exposure to a specific AVS, LAT can serve
    as a foundational restaking asset in the DeFi ecosystem, enabling the
    creation of more advanced restaking strategies or products. With
    EigenExplorer's integrated dashboard, users can create and monitor a
    real-time restaking portfolio, managing risk exposure all in one place.
