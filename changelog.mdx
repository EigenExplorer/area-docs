## Introducing North Star: Our Next Major Release

Since our inception, EigenExplorer has been on a mission to serve Restakers, AVSs, and Operators â€” the core entities of the EigenLayer ecosystem. To date, EigenExplorer has served over 4 million requests and 10,000 clients with our data platform. As the EigenLayer ecosystem grows, we are expanding our product horizon beyond data to meet its evolving needs.

Today, we are excited to introduce the Liquid AVS Token (LAT), an innovative asset class designed specifically for the EigenLayer ecosystem. LAT enables direct restaking into one AVS, automatic operator selection, and the use of liquid tokens for other DeFi activities. This new asset class promises improved utility, efficiency, and user experience. LAT allows users to directly support any AVS of their choice, fostering direct AVS community engagement and ensuring ecosystem longevity.

The Liquid AVS Token testnet will be launched in mid-August 2024, while the mainnet is scheduled for release in September 2024. We invite you to join us on this journey as we introduce LAT and continue to enhance the EigenLayer ecosystem.

## Data Quality, Standardization, and Consistency Improvements

Thanks to our users and community, we have crossed 100k requests and reached 3.4k unique users in the past month. In our latest update, we've focused on enhancing data quality, standardization, and consistency across the EigenExplorer platform.

Key improvements include:

-   **Data Methodology Page**: Added a [Data Methodology](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/methodology) page to provide transparency on data sources and processing methods.
-   **Beacon Chain TVL Calculation**: Updated and aligned the calculation of Beacon Chain TVL with the methodology used on the EigenLayer Dashboard, thanks to feedback from our user [Karl](https://twitter.com/karl_0x).
-   **AVS Count and Listing**: Fixed the AVS count and listing display for AVSs without metadata.
-   **Eigen Token and Strategy**: Included `Eigen` token and strategy data.
-   **TVL Conversion Standardization**: Unified the TVL conversion to `ETH` for all LST strategies.

Now, for selected routes, you can optionally add a `withTvl` flag to include the Total Value Locked (TVL) breakdown in the response.

This feature provides a detailed breakdown of the TVL for different strategies, saving time to calculate the TVL from shares in your aplication.

## Additional API Routes and Usability Improvements

We're excited to announce the addition of two new routes to the EigenExplorer API, [Retrieve AVS Operators](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/metrics/retrieve-total-number-of-avs-operators) and [Retrieve AVS Stakers](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/metrics/retrieve-total-number-of-avs-stakers). These routes allow developers to track the current operators and stakers associated with a specific AVS address. We are excited to see how the new endpoints will be utilized in the various AVS applications.

Further enhancing the EigenExplorer platform, we've implemented significant usability improvements. Our redesigned error handling provides a top-tier developer experience, ensuring clearer and more actionable feedback. Additionally, we've enriched our API documentation with detailed examples and comprehensive response schemas, going the extra mile to support developers in integrating and leveraging our API effectively.

We are excited to announce the release of the EigenLayer Ethereum Mainnet API, following closely on the heels of our recent launch of the Holesky Testnet API earlier this week. This release achieves parity between the available on-chain data and API support across the EigenLayer smart contracts.

You can now access both the Ethereum Mainnet API at `https://api.eigenexplorer.com` and the Holesky Testnet API at `https://api-holesky.eigenexplorer.com` to programmatically retrieve EigenLayer data.

Today we are releasing the first version of the EigenExplorer API, allowing developers to access EigenLayer AVS data programmatically.

The API provides endpoints for retrieving general EigenLayer metrics, AVS, operators, and stakers data, as well as strategy information. In the upcoming days, we will be adding more endpoints and features to the API, including historical data and API authentication.

We are excited to see what you will build with the EigenExplorer API!
