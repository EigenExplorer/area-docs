The direct liquid restaking rewards can be broken down into 3 parts:
    1. **ETH Liquid Staking Token Yield**: The base yield earned from staking ETH through liquid staking protocols.
    2. **AVS yield**: Rewards generated directly from the Autonomous Verifiable Service (AVS) you choose to support.
    3. **EigenLayer Programmatic Incentives**: Additional incentives distributed by EigenLayer, in the form of EIGEN token.

## Auto-Compounding
To help maximize your yield, Area automatically compounds your rewards. This means the rewards you earn are continuously reinvested into your staked position â€” allowing you to earn rewards on your rewards without manual intervention.
