## Liquid AVS Token (LAT)

LAT is a product of the [Direct Liquid Staking](./introduction) design, offering a new asset category that enhances efficiency in the AVS ecosystem. It allows users to hold (re)staked tokens in liquid form while directly supporting specific AVS.

    LATs are also known as X tokens, prefixed with "x" (e.g., `xEigenDA` for
    EigenDA AVS).

## Why LAT?

While EigenLayer restaking enhances the capital efficiency of ETH/LST holders through shared security, it traditionally limits users from choosing which AVS they wish to support and earn yield from.

Typically, users must delegate AVS selection to operators or liquid restaking token (LRT) platforms such as Renzo, EtherFi, and Puffer. These platforms then decide which AVS to validate at any given time. This delegation directly impacts your risk exposure and potential yield.

Though diversification can be achieved by holding or staking across multiple AVS, the operator delegation and LRT model complicate risk management, reward distribution, user experience, and support for a desired AVS.

## Benefits of Using LAT

To find more benefits of using LAT, you can check the [Why LAT?](/lat/why-lat) page. Here are a brief overview of the benefits:

1. **Directly Restake into Your Chosen AVS**: Gain more control over where your assets are allocated by selecting the AVS you wish to support.
2. **Automate Operator Selection**: Benefit from an automated process that prioritizes efficient and optimal operator choices.
3. **Provide Liquidity for DeFi Activities**: Use your LAT as a liquid token to participate in other DeFi activities, enhancing flexibility and capital utilization.
4. **Enjoy Enhanced Utility and Efficiency**: Experience improved token utility, efficiency, and overall user experience by directly engaging with the AVS ecosystem.

## What does LAT Support?

LAT functions alongside two existing token classes:

-   [Ethereum Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)](/glossaries/lst)
-   [Native AVS tokens](/glossaries/avs-token) issued by AVS protocols built on EigenLayer.
