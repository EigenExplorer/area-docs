**Direct Liquid Restaking** is a new framework that enables users to directly restake their assets into a specific Autonomous Verifiable Service (AVS), bypassing the need to manually select an operator. Built on top of EigenLayer’s native restaking interface, this design simplifies user experience and improves clarity around risk and reward.

The Problem with Traditional Restaking
EigenLayer and most existing restaking protocols require users to delegate their stake to operators, who then choose which AVSs to support. This indirect model introduces several challenges:

No Direct AVS Selection: Users can’t stake directly into a service—they must go through an operator.

Opaque Diversification: Operators often support multiple AVSs, creating passive diversification that users don’t control.

Unclear Risk/Reward: Users struggle to evaluate their exposure and the return profile of their stake due to the system’s complexity.



The direct liquid restaking system offers several key features and improvements over the original design:

1. **Automated Operator Selection**: Instead of users manually choosing an operator, a smart contract automatically calculates each operator's contribution to the chosen AVS's security. A security contribution threshold is introduced to identify high-concentration operators for a given AVS.

        We offer both Automated Operator Selection, which diversifies stakes
        across multiple operators, and a protocol-operated option for single-AVS
        restaking with higher yields through operator fee rebates.

1. **Pooled Stake Management**: User stakes are pooled and programmatically allocated to selected operators. The pool dynamically rebalances operator selection as operators move above or below the security contribution threshold.

1. **Automatic Compounding**: Rewards are automatically compounded to maximize yield generation.

1. **Liquid Token Generation**: Users receive a [liquid token](./lat) representing their restaking position in a specific AVS. This token can be freely traded or utilized in various DeFi activities, such as loans or actively managed strategies.

This approach streamlines the restaking process, optimizes security distribution, and provides users with flexible options for managing their staked assets.
