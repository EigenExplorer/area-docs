## Introduction

Operators are the entities that run and operate the individual actively validated services.

### Data Source

Currently, we aggregate data on the operators from the [Delegation Manager](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/dev/src/contracts/core/DelegationManager.sol) contract. You can find these contracts here:
