## Introduction

Stakers are the ETH or liquid staking token holders who delegate their tokens to operators and contribute to an AVS's economic security. Stakers receive rewards for their contributions to the network.

### Data Source

Currently, we aggregate data on the operators from the [Delegation Manager](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/dev/src/contracts/core/DelegationManager.sol) contract. You can find these contracts here:

-   [Ethereum Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x39053D51B77DC0d36036Fc1fCc8Cb819df8Ef37A)
-   [Holesky Testnet](https://holesky.etherscan.io/address/0xA44151489861Fe9e3055d95adC98FbD462B948e7)
