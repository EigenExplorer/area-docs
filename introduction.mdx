## What is Area

AREA is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid restaking protocol that **allows users to directly restake into networks and services** within Ethereumâ€™s EigenLayer ecosystem.

Rather than relying on operators to delegate on your behalf, you can restake directly into the preferred Autonomous Verifiable Services (AVSs), earning rewards exclusively from those AVSs while retaining full control over your assets.
